Changelog
=========


2.24 (2023-10-19)
-----------------

- Added `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn.ai_reloaded_fields` functionnality:
  this will force update cached widget and remove its terms if any, this is
  useful when using a context aware vocabulary.
  [gbastien]
- Removed the `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn` `get_ai_xxx` accessors,
  access the attribute directly instead.
  [gbastien]
- Added attribute `BaseColumn.the_object=False`, this means that we are getting
  the information on the object and not on the brain.
  Removed recently added columns `AwakeObjectVocabularyColumn` and
  `AwakeObjectAbbrColumn`, simply use `the_object=True` in this case.
  [gbastien]

2.23 (2023-09-04)
-----------------

- Added `AwakeObjectVocabularyColumn` and `AwakeObjectAbbrColumn`, having same
  behavior as `VocabularyColumn` and `AbbrColumn` but `attrName` is get on awaken
  object instead brain metadata, this avoids adding a `portal_catalog` metadata.
  [gbastien]
- In `AwakeObject` columns, use `imio.helpers.content.base_getattr` instead
  `getattr` to avoid problems with acquisiton.
  [gbastien]

2.22 (2023-08-24)
-----------------

- Rely on `imio.helpers.content.get_user_fullname` that manages fallback to
  `getMemberInfo` if fullname not found in `mutable_properties`.
  This needs to rely on `imio.helpers` that is now a dependency.
  [gbastien]

2.21 (2023-06-27)
-----------------

- In `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn`, in the cached view, update widget
  when it is a `RelationChoice/RelationList` to get correct value.
  [gbastien]

2.20 (2023-06-21)
-----------------

- Corrected iteration problem if gotten value for column is None.
  [sgeulette]

2.19 (2023-02-27)
-----------------

- Extended JS function `toggleCheckboxes` to pass the select/unselect checkbox
  as first parameter and trigger the click event when checkboxes checked or unchecked.
  This changes nothing here but makes this function more useable in other contexts.
  [gbastien]
- JS function `preventDefaultClickTransition` was renamed to
  `preventDefaultClick` in `imio.actionspanel>=1.62`.
  [gbastien]
- Do not break in `I18nColumn` when translating a string with special chars.
  [gbastien]

2.18 (2022-06-14)
-----------------

- Added `BaseColumn.escape = True` so content is escaped.
  Manage escape manually for the `TitleColumn`,  `VocabularyColumn` and the
  `AbbrColumn`, set it to `False` for `CheckBoxColumn`, `ElementNumberColumn`
  and `ActionsColumn` that are entirely generated, set it to `False` for
  `PrettyLinkColumnNothing` as `imio.prettylink` manages it itself.
  [gbastien]

2.17 (2022-05-13)
-----------------

- Doing an unrestricted object get to increase performance.
  [sgeulette]

2.16 (2022-01-03)
-----------------

- Added debug mode when displaying results, this will display the time to
  render each cell, each column (total of every cells) and a global table total.
  Just add `debug=true` to the URL
  [gbastien]

2.15 (2021-11-08)
-----------------

- Renamed parameter passed to `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn.getPrettyLink`
  from `item` to `obj` as it is actually the `obj` that is received and not the `item`.
  [gbastien]
- Added attribute `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn.ai_included_fields`,
  by default it displayed every non empty fields, with this parameter it is
  possible to select which fields to display.
  [gbastien]

2.14 (2021-07-16)
-----------------

- Fixed the `CheckBoxColumn`, add a name to the select all/nothing checkbox so
  it is possible to have several checkbox columns (on same table or when
  displaying several tables on same page).
  [gbastien]

2.13 (2021-01-06)
-----------------

- Added possibility to define a `header_help` message that will be displayed
  when hovering header title.
  [gbastien]
- Added `<label>` tag around input for the `CheckBoxColumn` so it can be syled
  to ease checkbox selection on click.
  [gbastien]

2.12 (2020-10-02)
-----------------

- In `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn`, use IDataManager to get widget value.
  [gbastien]

2.11 (2020-08-18)
-----------------

- Render `DataGridField` in `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn` vertically.
  [gbastien]
- Bugfix in `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn`, sometimes the widget's
  context was the previous row object.
  [gbastien]
- Added parameter `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn.simplified_datagridfield`
  and set it to `False` by default.
  [gbastien]
- Moved `MemberIdColumn.get_user_fullname` out of `MemberIdColumn` so it can be
  easily used from outside.
  [gbastien]
- Added `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn.ai_extra_fields`, that
  let's include extra data not present in schema, by default this will include
  `id`, `UID` and `description`.
  [gbastien]

2.10 (2020-05-08)
-----------------

- In `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn`, removed to setup around current URL
  that was necessary for displaying image and files correctly but instead,
  require `plone.formwidget.namedfile>=2.0.2` that solves the problem.
  [gbastien]

2.9 (2020-02-25)
----------------

- Ignored EMPTY_STRING in VocabularyColumn
  [sgeulette]

2.8 (2020-02-06)
----------------

- Managed correctly a field not yet set.
  [sgeulette]
- In the `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn`, manage `description` manually
  as it is not present in the `@@view` widgets.
  Display it as any other fields if not empty.
  [gbastien]
- Added IconsColumn
  [sgeulette]

2.7 (2019-09-13)
----------------

- In `columns.AbbrColumn`, make sure there is no `'` in tag title or it is not
  rendered correctly in the browser.
  [gbastien]

2.6 (2019-09-12)
----------------

- Fixed translation of `Please select at least one element.` msgid, it was
  still using the old domain `collective.eeafaceted.batchactions` from which
  the `select_row` column was reintegrated.
  [gbastien]
- Optimized the `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn` speed :

  - the `view.update` is called one time and we store the view in the column
    so next rows may use it;
  - use `collective.excelexport` datagridfield exportable to render a
    `datagridfield` because widget rendering is way too slow...
  - added `collective.excelexport` as a dependency.

  [gbastien]

2.5 (2019-08-02)
----------------

- In `VocabularyColumn` and `AbbrColumn`, store the vocabularies instances
  under `_cached_vocab_instance` to avoid doing a lookup for each row.
  This does speed rendering a lot.
  [gbastien]

2.4 (2019-03-28)
----------------

- Fix Date column with SolR result
  [mpeeters]
- Added `ExtendedCSSTable.table_id` and `ExtendedCSSTable.row_id_prefix` making
  it possible to have a CSS id on the table and for each rows.
  By default, we defined it for `FacetedTableView`, `table_id = 'faceted_table'`
  and `row_id_prefix = 'row_'`.
  [gbastien]
- For `ColorColumn`, do not redefine the `renderHeadCell` method but use the
  `header` attribute as we return static content.
  [gbastien]
- Added `BaseColumn.use_caching` attribute set to `True` by default that will
  avoid recomputing a value if it was already computed for a previous row.
  This needs to be managed by column and base `_get_cached_result` and
  `_store_cached_result` are defined on `BaseColumn`.
  Implementations are done for `DateColumn`, `VocabularyColumn` and `AbbrColumn`.
  [gbastien]

2.3 (2018-12-18)
----------------

- In `faceted-table-items.pt`, group `<span>` displaying number of results or
  no results under same `<div>` so it is easy to style.
  [gbastien]

2.2 (2018-11-20)
----------------

- Added `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn.ai_generate_css_class_fields`
  attribute to make it possible to specify fields we want to generate a
  CSS class for, depending on field name and value.  This is useful for
  applying custom CSS to a particular additional info field having a
  specific value.
  [gbastien]

2.1 (2018-09-04)
----------------

- Added `BooleanColumn` based on the `I18nColumn` that displays `Yes` or `No`
  depending on fact that value is `True` or `False`.
  [gbastien]
- Added `PrettyLinkColumn` and `PrettyLinkWithAdditionalInfosColumn` columns
  based on soft dependency to `imio.prettylink`.
  [gbastien]
- Added `ActionsColumn` column based on soft dependency to `imio.actionspanel`.
  [gbastien]
- Added `RelationPrettyLinkColumn` column displaying a relation as a
  pretty link.
  [gbastien]
- Moved overrides of `SequenceTable.renderRow` and `SequenceTable.renderCell`
  relative to being able to define CSS classes by `<td>` tag and depending on
  item value to a separated `ExtendedCSSTable class` so it can be reused by
  other packages.
  [gbastien]

2.0 (2018-06-20)
----------------

- Make widget compatible with `eea.facetednavigation >= 10.0`.
  This makes it no more compatible with older version.
  [gbastien]

  [gbastien]
- Reintegrated the `select_row` column from `collective.eeafaceted.batchactions`
  as it is useable by other Faceted packages.

  [gbastien]

  so in case table is too large, the column does not shrink to nothing.
  [gbastien]
- Use `__name__` instead of `attrName` to generate `th_header_` and `td_cell_` CSS classes
  so 2 columns using the same `attrName` get different CSS classes.

  [gbastien]

0.9 (2016-01-04)
